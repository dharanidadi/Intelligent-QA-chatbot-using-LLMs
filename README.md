# Intelligent-QA-chatbot-using-LLMs


I developed a mental health chatbot using instruction-tuned Language Models to provide tailored and sensitive responses. I curated a comprehensive mental health disorder dataset by web-scraping relevant Wikipedia articles and entries. Additionally, I designed a FAISS-integrated Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) model to enable efficient searches, reducing latency and achieving a response accuracy of 95%.
